# Use Case 2: Automated Competitive Research with Workflows

## Who This Is For
Product managers who need to regularly track competitor features and capabilities.

## The Problem
Every quarter, you need to research your competitors to understand:
- What new features they've launched
- How their capabilities compare to yours
- Where you're falling behind or leading

This competitive analysis is critical for strategic planning, but it's incredibly time-consuming. You have 5-10 competitors to research, and doing this manually every quarter feels like a never-ending chore.

## The Manual Way (Without AI Researcher)

**Time Required: 6-8 hours per quarter**

For each competitor, you need to:
1. Open your AI chat tool (like Gemini)
2. Ask about the competitor's features
3. Copy responses to a document
4. Visit the competitor's website
5. Take screenshots and notes
6. Ask more specific questions
7. Copy more responses
8. Organize everything into a readable format
9. Create a separate file for each competitor
10. Manually create a comparison table
11. Update the table with each competitor's info
12. Try to remember what you researched last quarter
13. Repeat for every single competitor

**Pain Points:**
- Extremely repetitive work - same process for each competitor
- Takes an entire day or more each quarter
- Easy to miss competitors or forget to update information
- Manual comparison table creation is tedious
- Hard to track changes from last quarter
- By the time you finish, you're already dreading next quarter

## How AI Researcher Helps with Workflows

**Time Required: 30-45 minutes per quarter**

1. **One-time setup** - Create a project and list your competitors in a file
2. **Create a workflow** - Build a reusable workflow that:
   - Takes your competitor list
   - Researches each competitor automatically
   - Extracts current features and capabilities
   - Creates organized files for each competitor
3. **Run it** - Click to execute the workflow
4. **Parallel processing** - AI Researcher researches all competitors at the same time (not one by one)
5. **Automatic files** - Get an updated file for each competitor with their latest features
6. **Comparison table** - AI Researcher generates a summary table comparing your product vs all competitors

**Key Benefits:**
- Set it up once, use it every quarter
- All competitors researched in parallel (not sequentially)
- Consistent research format every time
- No manual copy-pasting or file creation
- Automatic comparison table generation
- Easy to spot changes from previous quarters
- Reusable workflow saves massive time

## What You Get

- Individual files for each competitor with their current features and capabilities
- A comprehensive comparison table showing your product vs competitors
- Consistent, organized documentation
- Historical data you can compare quarter over quarter
- A workflow you can run again next quarter in minutes

## Time Saved
**6-8 hours per quarter → 30-45 minutes per quarter** (saving 5-7 hours every quarter, or 20-28 hours per year)

## Why Workflows Matter
Without workflows, you'd still need to manually research each competitor one by one. Workflows let you:
- Automate repetitive tasks
- Process multiple items in parallel
- Reuse the same process again and again
- Save hours of manual work
