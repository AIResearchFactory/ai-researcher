# Use Case 3: Cross-Tool Integration with MCP

## Who This Is For
Product managers who use multiple tools (like Jira, Aha, Notion, etc.) and need to keep information synchronized across them.

## The Problem
You're managing a feature that involves multiple tools:
- Your PRD (Product Requirements Document) lives in **Aha** (a product management tool)
- Your development tasks are tracked in **Jira** (a project management tool)
- Your customer feedback is in **meeting notes** (Markdown files on your computer)

You need to make sure everything is aligned:
- Do all Jira tickets match the user stories in your Aha PRD?
- Does your PRD actually solve the problems customers mentioned in meetings?
- Are there missing user stories that should be added?

This cross-tool validation is critical but incredibly tedious.

## The Manual Way (Without AI Researcher)

**Time Required: 2-3 hours per feature**

1. Open Aha and read through your PRD
2. Copy user stories to a notepad
3. Open Jira in another tab
4. Search for tickets related to your feature
5. Compare each Jira ticket to your user stories
6. Switch back and forth between Aha and Jira
7. Open your meeting notes folder
8. Read through multiple customer meeting summaries
9. Try to remember which problems were mentioned
10. Compare problems to your PRD
11. Realize something is missing
12. Switch back to Aha to update the PRD
13. Switch to Jira to create a new ticket
14. Lose track of what you've already checked
15. Start over because you forgot something

**Pain Points:**
- Constant tool switching causes mental fatigue
- Easy to miss misalignments or gaps
- Manual comparison is error-prone
- Time-consuming to update multiple tools
- Hard to validate against scattered meeting notes
- No automated way to check completeness

## How AI Researcher Helps with MCP

**Time Required: 15-20 minutes per feature**

**What is MCP?** MCP (Model Context Protocol) is a technology that lets AI connect to your tools like Jira, Aha, Notion, and more. Think of it as giving AI the ability to read and write to your work tools.

1. **One-time setup** - Configure MCP connections:
   - Connect to your Jira workspace
   - Connect to your Aha account
   - Point to your meeting notes folder
2. **Create a validation workflow** - Build a workflow that:
   - Reads your PRD from Aha
   - Reads all related Jira tickets
   - Reads customer meeting summaries from your files
   - Compares everything automatically
3. **Run validation** - AI Researcher:
   - Checks if Jira tickets align with PRD user stories
   - Validates that PRD addresses customer problems from meetings
   - Identifies missing user stories or tickets
4. **Automatic updates** - AI Researcher can:
   - Update your PRD in Aha with missing information
   - Create new Jira tickets for missing user stories
   - Keep everything synchronized

**Key Benefits:**
- No more manual tool switching
- Automatic cross-tool validation
- AI reads from multiple sources simultaneously
- Identifies gaps and misalignments automatically
- Can update tools directly (with your approval)
- Consistent validation process every time

## What You Get

- A validated PRD in Aha that aligns with Jira tickets
- New Jira tickets automatically created for missing user stories
- Confidence that your PRD addresses real customer problems
- Complete alignment across all your tools
- Documentation of what was checked and updated

## Time Saved
**2-3 hours per feature → 15-20 minutes per feature** (saving 2+ hours per feature validation)

## Why MCP Matters
Without MCP, AI tools can only work with information you manually provide. With MCP:
- AI can directly access your tools (Jira, Aha, Notion, etc.)
- No more copy-pasting between tools
- AI can read and write to multiple systems
- Enables true cross-tool automation
- Works with your existing workflow and tools

## Common MCP Integrations
- **Jira** - Project management and issue tracking
- **Aha** - Product roadmap and PRD management
- **Notion** - Documentation and notes
- **GitHub** - Code repositories and issues
- **Slack** - Team communication
- **Google Drive** - Document storage
- And many more...
