# Use Case 1: Simple Research and Documentation

## Who This Is For
Product managers who need to research new feature ideas and create documentation.

## The Problem
You have a promising feature idea, but before you can move forward, you need to:
- Research similar features in other products
- Understand technical feasibility
- Document your findings
- Create a Product Requirements Document (PRD - a detailed specification of what the feature should do)

This process typically takes hours of work, switching between AI chat tools, note-taking apps, and document editors.

## The Manual Way (Without AI Researcher)

**Time Required: 3-4 hours**

1. Open your AI chat tool (like Gemini or ChatGPT)
2. Ask questions about your feature idea
3. Copy and paste responses into a separate document
4. Ask follow-up questions
5. Copy and paste more responses
6. Try to organize all the scattered information
7. Lose track of which questions you've already asked
8. Manually format everything into a coherent document
9. Create a separate PRD document from scratch
10. Copy relevant research findings into the PRD
11. Format and structure the PRD manually

**Pain Points:**
- Constant switching between tools
- Information scattered across chat history
- Manual copy-paste is tedious and error-prone
- Hard to keep track of research progress
- Time-consuming formatting and organization

## How AI Researcher Helps

**Time Required: 30-45 minutes**

1. **Create a project** - Set up a new project folder for your feature
2. **Start your research** - Create a file and describe your feature idea
3. **Chat naturally** - Use the built-in AI chat (with Gemini or other providers) to research
4. **Automatic documentation** - AI Researcher automatically saves all your research conversations to your project file
5. **Get a summary** - AI Researcher creates a clear summary of your findings
6. **Generate PRD** - AI Researcher creates a complete PRD as a Markdown document in your project folder

**Key Benefits:**
- Everything stays in one place - no more switching tools
- Your research is automatically documented as you go
- No manual copy-pasting needed
- Easy to review your research history
- Professional PRD generated automatically
- All files organized in your project folder

## What You Get

- A complete research file with all your questions and findings
- A clear summary of your research
- A professional PRD (Product Requirements Document) ready to share with your team
- Everything saved and organized in one project folder

## Time Saved
**3-4 hours → 30-45 minutes** (saving 2-3 hours per feature research)
