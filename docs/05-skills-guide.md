## What are Skills?

**Skills** are reusable AI agent templates that perform specific tasks consistently. Think of them as specialized AI assistants that are experts in particular areas.

### The Problem Skills Solve

Without skills, every time you need AI help, you have to:
- Explain what you want in detail
- Describe the format you need
- Hope for consistent results
- Repeat the same instructions across projects

**With skills**, you:
- Define the task once
- Reuse it across all projects
- Get consistent, high-quality results
- Build a library of specialized agents

### Real-World Analogy

Think of skills like hiring specialists:
- Instead of explaining to a generalist every time, you have a **Research Specialist** who knows exactly how to conduct research
- A **Competitive Analyst** who always delivers competitor analysis in your preferred format
- A **PRD Writer** who creates Product Requirements Documents following your template

---

## Why Use Skills?

### 1. Consistency
Get the same quality output every time, regardless of who uses the skill or when.

**Without skills**:
- Different team members get different results
- Quality varies based on how well you prompt
- Hard to maintain standards

**With skills**:
- Everyone gets the same high-quality output
- Consistent format and structure
- Reliable results

### 2. Efficiency
Save time by not repeating instructions.

**Without skills**:
- Re-explain the task every time
- Adjust prompts until you get it right
- Waste time on formatting instructions

**With skills**:
- One-click activation
- No need to explain
- Immediate, correct results

### 3. Specialization
Create AI agents that are experts in specific domains.

**Examples**:
- **Research Assistant** - Thorough, academic-style research
- **Competitive Analyst** - Business intelligence focus
- **Technical Writer** - Clear, structured documentation
- **Code Reviewer** - Security and best practices focus

### 4. Reusability
Use the same skill across multiple projects.

**Example**: Create a "Competitive Analyst" skill once, use it for:
- Q1 competitive analysis
- Q2 competitive analysis
- New market entry research
- Feature comparison studies

### 5. Sharing
Share skills with your team for consistent results across the organization.

## Understanding Skill Components

Every skill has four main components:

### 1. Name and Description

**Name**: Short, clear identifier
- Example: "Research Assistant", "Competitive Analyst", "PRD Generator"

**Description**: Brief explanation of what the skill does
- Example: "Conducts thorough research on topics and provides comprehensive, well-structured analysis with citations"

### 2. Role

Defines **who** the AI agent is. This sets the expertise level and perspective.

**Examples**:
- "You are a senior product manager with 10 years of experience in SaaS products"
- "You are an expert market researcher specializing in competitive intelligence"
- "You are a technical writer who creates clear, user-friendly documentation"

**Why it matters**: The role shapes how the AI approaches tasks and the depth of analysis.

### 3. Tasks

Defines **what** the AI agent does. Be specific about the steps and approach.

**Example for Research Assistant**:
```
Your tasks are to:
1. Conduct comprehensive research on the given topic
2. Gather information from multiple perspectives
3. Analyze and synthesize findings
4. Identify key insights and patterns
5. Provide citations and sources where applicable
6. Present findings in a clear, structured format
```

### 4. Output Format

Defines **how** results should be presented. Specify structure, style, and format.

**Example**:
```
Provide your research in the following format:

## Executive Summary
Brief overview of key findings (2-3 paragraphs)

## Detailed Analysis
### Topic 1
- Key points
- Supporting evidence
- Sources

### Topic 2
...

## Key Insights
- Insight 1
- Insight 2
...

## Recommendations
