- **Hosted API** - Cloud-based AI services (Claude, OpenAI, Gemini, etc.)

**How to select**:
1. Go to Settings → AI Configuration
2. Click the **"Active Provider"** dropdown
3. Select your preferred provider
4. Configure provider-specific settings below

#### Ollama Configuration

**When to use**: You want to run AI models locally on your computer.

**How to configure**:
1. Ensure Ollama is installed and running: `ollama serve`
2. Download a model: `ollama pull llama3`
3. In Settings, select the model from the dropdown
4. Test by sending a chat message

**Advantages**:

- ✅ Fast, reliable responses
- ✅ Regular model updates

**Limitations**:
- ❌ Requires API costs
- ❌ Needs internet connection
- ❌ Data sent to external servers

### API Keys and Security

AI Researcher takes security seriously. Your API keys are encrypted and stored locally.

#### How Security Works

1. **Encryption**: API keys are encrypted using AES-256-GCM encryption
2. **Password Protection**: Your password unlocks the encrypted keys
3. **Local Storage**: Keys never leave your computer
4. **No Cloud Sync**: Keys are not synced or backed up automatically

#### Why You Need a Password

Every time you launch AI Researcher, you'll be asked for your password. This is **by design** for security:

- Your password decrypts your API keys
- Without it, your keys remain encrypted and unusable
- This protects your keys if someone accesses your computer
- It's similar to how password managers work

**Important**: There is no way to recover your password. If you forget it, you'll need to re-enter your API keys.

#### Adding an API Key

1. Go to Settings → AI Configuration
2. Scroll to **"API Keys and Secrets"**
3. Click **"Add API Key"**
4. Enter:
   - **Secret ID**: Name for this key (e.g., `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`)
   - **Secret Value**: Your actual API key
5. Click **"Save"**
6. The key is encrypted and stored

**Security note**: Once saved, the key is shown as `••••••••••••••••` for security.

#### Managing API Keys

**To update a key**:
1. Go to Settings → API Keys
2. Find the key you want to update
3. Click **"Edit"**
4. Enter the new value
5. Click **"Save"**

**To delete a key**:
1. Find the key
2. Click **"Delete"**
3. Confirm deletion

**Best practices**:
- Use descriptive Secret IDs
- Rotate keys periodically
- Don't share your password
- Keep a secure backup of your keys (separately from AI Researcher)

#### Common API Keys

| Secret ID | Used For | Get Key From |
|-----------|----------|--------------|
| `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` | Claude models | [console.anthropic.com](https://console.anthropic.com) |
| `OPENAI_API_KEY` | GPT models | [platform.openai.com](https://platform.openai.com) |
| `GOOGLE_API_KEY` | Gemini models | [makersuite.google.com](https://makersuite.google.com) |
| `GITHUB_TOKEN` | GitHub MCP | [github.com/settings/tokens](https://github.com/settings/tokens) |

### MCP Server Configuration

**MCP (Model Context Protocol)** allows AI to connect to external tools and data sources.

#### What is MCP?

MCP gives your AI assistant the ability to:
- Read from GitHub repositories
- Search the web
- Access local files
- Query databases
- Interact with Jira, Notion, and other tools

**Think of it as**: Giving your AI assistant hands to interact with your tools.

#### Why Use MCP?

**Without MCP**:
- You manually copy data from tools to AI
- AI can't access real-time information
- No cross-tool automation

**With MCP**:
- AI reads directly from your tools
- Real-time data access
- Automated cross-tool workflows

[See Use Case 3 for a detailed example →](use-cases/Use-Case3-Using_MCP.md)

#### Available MCP Servers

Popular MCP servers you can configure:

| Server | Purpose | Use Case |
|--------|---------|----------|
| **Brave Search** | Web search | Research current information |
| **Filesystem** | Local file access | Read/write project files |
| **Ollama** | Local AI models | Use local models via MCP |
| **GitHub** | Repository access | Analyze code, issues, PRs |
| **Git** | Git operations | Repository analysis |
| **PostgreSQL** | Database queries | Data analysis |

#### Adding an MCP Server

1. Go to Settings → AI Configuration
2. Scroll to **"MCP Servers"**
3. Click **"+ Add MCP Server"**
4. Fill in the configuration:
   - **ID**: Unique identifier (e.g., `brave-search`)
   - **Name**: Display name (e.g., `Brave Search`)
   - **Command**: Usually `npx`
   - **Args**: Server-specific arguments
   - **Enabled**: Toggle on to activate
5. Click **"Save"**

#### Example: Adding Brave Search

```
ID: brave-search
Name: Brave Search
Command: npx
Args: -y @modelcontextprotocol/server-brave-search
Enabled: ✓
```

**What you need**: Brave Search API key (add to API Keys section)

#### Example: Adding Filesystem Access

```
ID: filesystem
Name: Filesystem
Command: npx
Args: -y @modelcontextprotocol/server-filesystem /Users/yourname/Documents
Enabled: ✓
```

**Note**: Replace `/Users/yourname/Documents` with the path you want to grant access to.

#### Example: Adding GitHub

```
ID: github
Name: GitHub
Command: npx
Args: -y @modelcontextprotocol/server-github
Enabled: ✓
```

**What you need**: GitHub personal access token (add to API Keys as `GITHUB_TOKEN`)

#### Managing MCP Servers

**To enable/disable**:
1. Find the server in the list
2. Toggle the **"Enabled"** switch
3. Changes apply immediately

**To edit**:
1. Click the server
2. Modify settings
3. Click **"Save"**

#### MCP Server Documentation

For detailed setup instructions for specific MCP servers, refer to:
- [MCP Documentation](https://modelcontextprotocol.io)
- [MCP Server Registry](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/servers)
- Provider-specific documentation

**Note**: AI Researcher provides the general MCP configuration interface. Specific server setup may require additional steps (API keys, permissions, etc.).

3. Re-enter the key in Settings
4. Try a different key

#### "Cannot Connect to Ollama"

**Possible causes**:
- Ollama is not running
- Ollama is not installed
- Wrong port or configuration

**Solutions**:
1. Start Ollama: `ollama serve`
2. Verify installation: `ollama --version`
3. Check if Ollama is running on port 11434
4. In Settings, click "Re-detect Dependencies"

#### "MCP Server Not Responding"

**Possible causes**:
- Server not installed
- Missing dependencies
- Incorrect configuration
- Missing API keys

**Solutions**:

#### "Password Incorrect"

**Possible causes**:
- Wrong password entered
- Caps Lock is on
- Password was changed

**Solutions**:
1. Try entering the password again carefully
2. Check Caps Lock
3. If forgotten, you'll need to reset (see below)

#### Forgot Password

Unfortunately, there's no way to recover a forgotten password. Your options:

1. **Reset and re-enter keys**:
   - Close AI Researcher
   - Delete `.secrets.encrypted` from your data directory
   - Restart AI Researcher
   - Re-enter all API keys with a new password

2. **Keep a secure backup**:
   - Store API keys in a password manager
   - Keep a secure note of your AI Researcher password

### Settings Not Saving

**Possible causes**:
- File permissions issue
- Disk full
- Settings file corrupted

**Solutions**:
1. Check disk space
2. Verify you have write permissions to the data directory
3. Try restarting AI Researcher
4. Check the logs for error messages

### Performance Issues

**If AI Researcher is slow**:
1. Check your data directory size
2. Close unused projects
3. Disable unused MCP servers
4. Clear old chat transcripts
5. Restart the application

## Best Practices

### Security

- **Use strong passwords** for encryption
- **Rotate API keys** periodically
- **Don't share** your password or keys
- **Keep backups** of your keys (securely, outside AI Researcher)
- **Use project encryption** for sensitive research

### Organization

- **Set clear project goals** to help AI understand context
- **Assign relevant skills** to projects
- **Use descriptive names** for everything
- **Review settings** periodically

### Performance

- **Disable unused MCP servers** to reduce overhead
- **Choose appropriate models** (smaller = faster)
- **Use local models** (Ollama) for simple tasks
- **Use hosted APIs** for complex tasks

### Cost Management

If using hosted APIs:
- **Monitor usage** in your provider's dashboard
- **Set spending limits** if available
- **Use local models** for development/testing
- **Choose cost-effective models** for simple tasks
