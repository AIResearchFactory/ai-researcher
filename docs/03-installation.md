## Optional Dependencies

AI Researcher works great with hosted AI services (Claude, OpenAI, Gemini), but you can optionally install local AI tools for additional capabilities.

### Ollama (Optional)

**What it is**: Run AI models locally on your computer without API keys.

**Why use it**: Privacy, no API costs, works offline.

**Installation**:

**macOS/Linux**:
```bash
curl -fsSL https://ollama.ai/install.sh | sh
```

**Windows**:
Download from [ollama.ai](https://ollama.ai) and run the installer.

**Verify installation**:
```bash
ollama --version
```

**Download a model**:
```bash
ollama pull llama3
```

### Claude Code (Optional)

**What it is**: Anthropic's coding assistant with advanced code analysis.

**Why use it**: Specialized for code review, debugging, and development tasks.

**Installation**:
Visit [Anthropic's documentation](https://docs.anthropic.com) for installation instructions specific to your platform.

### Gemini CLI (Optional)

**What it is**: Google's Gemini AI accessible via command line.

**Why use it**: Alternative to Claude/OpenAI with different capabilities.

**Installation**:
Follow Google's official Gemini CLI installation guide.

### Important Notes

- **These are all optional** - AI Researcher works perfectly with hosted APIs
- You can install them later if you want
- Use them as examples of what's possible
- Choose based on your needs and preferences

## Initial Configuration

After installation, you'll want to configure your AI provider and add API keys.

### Step 1: Open Settings

1. Click the **menu icon** (☰) in the top-left
2. Select **"Settings"**
3. You'll see the **Global Settings** page

### Step 2: Choose Your AI Provider

In the **AI Configuration** section:

1. Click the **"Active Provider"** dropdown
2. Choose your preferred provider:
   - **Ollama via MCP** - Local AI (requires Ollama installed)
   - **Claude Code** - Anthropic's coding assistant (requires Claude Code)
   - **Hosted API** - Claude, OpenAI, Gemini, etc.

### Step 3: Add API Keys (for Hosted APIs)

If you're using hosted APIs:

1. Scroll to **"API Keys"**
2. Click **"Add API Key"**
3. Enter your API key (get one from [Anthropic](https://console.anthropic.com), [OpenAI](https://platform.openai.com), etc.)
4. Click **"Save"**

**Security note**: Your API keys are encrypted using AES-256-GCM encryption and stored locally. You'll need to enter your password each time you launch AI Researcher to unlock them.

### Step 4: Configure Your Provider

Depending on your chosen provider:

**For Ollama**:
- Select your preferred model (e.g., `llama3`, `mistral`)
- Ensure Ollama is running: `ollama serve`

**For Hosted APIs**:
- Select your model (e.g., `claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022`)
- Verify your API key is entered

### Step 5: Test Your Configuration

1. Create a test project (see [Projects Guide](04-projects-guide.md))
2. Open the AI Chat panel
3. Send a simple message like "Hello, can you help me?"
4. If you get a response, you're all set!

## Verification

To verify your installation is working correctly:

### 1. Check Data Directory
- Open Settings → General
- Verify the data directory path is correct
- Navigate to that folder in your file explorer
- You should see `projects/`, `skills/`, and other folders

### 2. Check AI Provider
- Open Settings → AI Configuration
- Verify your provider is selected
- Check that API keys are saved (shown as `••••••••`)

### 3. Test AI Chat
- Create a new project
- Open the chat panel
- Send a test message
- Verify you receive a response

### 4. Check File Creation
- Create a new file in your project
- Write some content
- Navigate to your data directory
- Verify the file exists as a `.md` file

## Troubleshooting

### Installation Issues

**Problem**: "App can't be opened" on macOS  
**Solution**: Go to System Preferences → Security & Privacy → Click "Open Anyway"

**Problem**: Windows SmartScreen warning  
**Solution**: Click "More info" → "Run anyway"

**Problem**: Linux permission denied  
**Solution**: Make the AppImage executable: `chmod +x ai-researcher*.AppImage`

### Configuration Issues

**Problem**: Can't find data directory  
**Solution**: 
1. Open Settings
2. Click "Change Data Directory"
3. Select or create a new folder
4. Restart AI Researcher

**Problem**: API key not working  
**Solution**:
1. Verify the key is correct (check your AI provider's dashboard)
2. Ensure you have API credits/quota available
3. Try removing and re-adding the key
4. Check your internet connection

**Problem**: Ollama not detected  
**Solution**:
1. Verify Ollama is installed: `ollama --version`
2. Start Ollama service: `ollama serve`
3. In AI Researcher, go to Settings → Click "Re-detect Dependencies"

### Password Issues

**Problem**: Forgot password  
**Solution**: Unfortunately, encrypted secrets cannot be recovered without the password. You'll need to:
1. Delete the `.secrets.encrypted` file from your data directory
2. Re-enter your API keys
3. Set a new password

**Problem**: Password prompt every time  
**Solution**: This is by design for security. Your password unlocks your encrypted API keys. There's no way to disable this while maintaining encryption.

### Performance Issues

**Problem**: App is slow  
**Solution**:
1. Check if you have many large files in projects
2. Close unused projects
3. Ensure you have enough RAM available
4. Try restarting the application

**Problem**: AI responses are slow  
**Solution**:
1. This is usually due to the AI provider's response time
2. Try a different model (smaller models are faster)
3. Check your internet connection
4. For Ollama, ensure your computer meets the model's requirements

### Getting More Help

If you're still having issues:

1. Check the [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/AIResearchFactory/ai-researcher/issues) page
2. Search for similar problems
3. Create a new issue with:
   - Your operating system and version
   - AI Researcher version
   - Steps to reproduce the problem
   - Any error messages
