## What is a Project?

A **project** is an organized workspace for a specific research topic or goal. Think of it as a dedicated folder that contains:

- All your research notes and documents
- AI chat conversations (automatically saved)
- Workflows specific to this research
- Project-specific settings

**Example projects**:
- "Q1 2026 Competitive Analysis"
- "New Feature Research - Dark Mode"
- "Customer Interview Synthesis"
- "Market Research - AI Tools Landscape"

**Why use projects**:
- **Organization**: Keep different research topics separate
- **Context**: AI understands what you're working on
- **History**: Full record of your research process
- **Sharing**: Easy to share entire projects with teammates
- **Portability**: All data in simple Markdown files

---

## Creating a Project

### Step 1: Open the New Project Dialog

1. Click the **"Projects"** tab in the left sidebar
2. Click the **"+ New Project"** button
3. The "Create New Project" dialog appears

### Step 2: Fill in Project Details

**Project Name** (required)
- Give your project a clear, descriptive name
- Example: "Q1 2026 Competitive Analysis"
- This becomes the folder name (lowercase, with hyphens)

**Project Goal** (required)
- Describe what you want to achieve
- Be specific - this helps AI understand your context
- Example: "Research top 5 competitors in the AI research tools space, analyze their features, pricing, and positioning, and create a comprehensive comparison report"

**Assign Skills** (optional)
- Select pre-existing skills to use in this project
- You can add or change skills later
- Example: Select "Research Assistant" and "Competitive Analyst"

### Step 3: Create the Project

1. Click **"Create Project"**
2. AI Researcher creates the project folder and initial files
3. Your new project appears in the sidebar
4. The project opens automatically

### What Gets Created

When you create a project, AI Researcher automatically sets up:

```
your-project-name/
├── .metadata/
│   └── project.json          # Project metadata
├── README.md                  # Initial project overview
└── (your files will go here)
```

---

## Project Structure

### Understanding Your Project Folder

Each project is a folder in your data directory containing:

**Visible Files** (your content):
- `README.md` - Project overview and notes
- `research-notes.md` - Your research findings
- `chat-2026-01-15.md` - AI chat transcripts (auto-created)
- Any other `.md` files you create

**Hidden Folders** (system files):
- `.metadata/` - Project configuration and metadata
- `.workflows/` - Workflow definitions (JSON files)

**Important**: You can edit any `.md` file with any text editor. They're just plain Markdown!

### File Naming Conventions

AI Researcher automatically names files based on their purpose:

- **Chat transcripts**: `chat-YYYY-MM-DD.md` or `chat-YYYY-MM-DD-HH-MM.md`
- **Project files**: Whatever you name them (e.g., `competitive-analysis.md`)

**Best practices**:
- Use lowercase with hyphens: `feature-research.md`
- Be descriptive: `competitor-pricing-analysis.md` not `notes.md`
- Date important files: `2026-01-15-interview-summary.md`

The selected provider is saved in your global settings.

### Starting a Conversation

1. Type your question or request in the text box
2. Press **Enter** or click the **Send** button (➤)
3. AI responds in the chat panel
4. Continue the conversation naturally

**Example conversation**:
```
You: Can you help me research the top AI research tools?

AI: I'd be happy to help! Let me research the top AI research 
tools for you. Based on current market analysis, here are the 
leading tools...

You: Can you create a comparison table of their pricing?

AI: Certainly! Here's a comparison table...
```

### How Chat History is Saved

**Automatic documentation** - This is the magic:

1. Every conversation is automatically saved to your project
2. Chat transcripts are saved as Markdown files
3. Files are named with timestamps: `chat-2026-01-15.md`
4. You can review any conversation later
5. No manual copy-pasting needed!

**What gets saved**:
```markdown
# Chat Session - 2026-01-15

## User
Can you help me research the top AI research tools?

## Assistant
I'd be happy to help! Let me research the top AI research 
tools for you...

## User
Can you create a comparison table of their pricing?

## Assistant
Certainly! Here's a comparison table...
```

### Using Project Context

The AI is aware of your project:

- It knows your project goal
- It can reference your project files
- It maintains context across conversations
- It can help organize your research

**Example**:
```
You: Based on my project goal, what should I research first?

AI: Given your goal of "analyzing top 5 competitors," I 
recommend starting with...
```

### Attaching Files and Workflows

You can reference project files and workflows directly in your conversation:

**Method 1: Using @ for Files**
1. Type `@` in the chat input
2. Select a file from the list
3. The AI can now read and reference that file

**Method 2: Using # for Workflows**
1. Type `#` in the chat input
2. Select a workflow from the list
3. Press Enter to run it or ask questions about it

**Method 3: Using the Paperclip**
1. Click the **paperclip icon** (📎) in the chat input
2. Select files from your project

**Example use cases**:
- "Summarize key points from @research-notes.md"
- "Run #CompetitiveResearch for these companies..."
- "Compare @competitor-1.md and @competitor-2.md"

### Chat Best Practices

**Be specific**:
- ❌ "Research competitors"
- ✅ "Research the top 5 AI research tools, focusing on their pricing models, key features, and target customers"

**Provide context**:
- Reference your project goal
- Mention what you've already researched
- Specify the format you want (table, bullet points, etc.)

**Iterate**:
- Start broad, then drill down
- Ask follow-up questions
- Request different formats or perspectives

**Use skills**:
- Assign relevant skills to your project
- Reference skills in your prompts: "Using the Research Assistant skill, analyze..."

## Best Practices

### Project Organization

**One project per topic**:
- Don't mix unrelated research in one project
- Create separate projects for different goals
- Example: Separate projects for "Q1 Competitors" and "Q2 Competitors"

**Clear goals**:
- Write specific, actionable goals
- Update goals as your research evolves
- Good goal: "Analyze top 5 competitors' pricing strategies and create recommendations"
- Poor goal: "Research stuff"

**Consistent naming**:
- Use a naming convention for projects
- Example: "YYYY-QQ - Topic" → "2026-Q1 - Competitive Analysis"
- Makes projects easy to find and sort

### File Management

**Start with README**:
- Use `README.md` as your project overview
- Include project goal, status, and key findings
- Link to other important files

**Separate concerns**:
- One file per major topic or competitor
- Don't create one giant file
- Easier to navigate and share

**Use descriptive names**:
- `competitor-analysis-acme-corp.md` ✅
- `notes.md` ❌

### Chat Usage

**Save important insights**:
- While chat is auto-saved, copy key insights to your main files
- Create summary documents from chat findings
- Don't rely solely on chat transcripts for final deliverables

**Reference previous chats**:
- Review old chat files before starting new conversations
- Avoid asking the same questions twice
- Build on previous research

**Organize chat files**:
- Chat files accumulate over time
- Consider archiving old chats to a subfolder
- Keep active research chats easily accessible
